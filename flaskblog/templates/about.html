                    <p> Acronyms are a highly productive form of term representation. In 1970, Britton observed that “in science, new words normally emerge in response to the need for novel, precise, and economical communication” and that the acronym is a result of the “need for economy and convenience of expression … usually formed from the initials of a phrase name”. It is now rather unusual when a medical condition or procedure does not come with an associated acronym or initialism, for example, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), HRT (hormone replacement therapy), and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), to name a few. In an editorial lamenting the use, overuse, misuse or abuse of acronyms in medicals journals, its mentioned that in one issue of a clinical journal, fifty-two acronyms are found. Fred and Cheng go further nothing that more than ninety undefined acronyms were in one review article. Particularly in the domain of biomedical texts, this results in the challenge of identifying commonly used abbreviations’ definitions in order to keep relevant ontologies up to date. </p>
    
                    <p>Given the common use of acronyms in health sciences, researchers may be more disposed to search abbreviated terms rather than full phrases when searching online systems. Even more so when the full phrase is lengthy or difficult to spell. Searchers may also know the acronym but are ensure of its exact meaning, they may also assume that any online systems will properly translate acronyms to their corresponding full phrases automatically. Without a biomedical dictionary of acronyms and their full form definitions to hand, this too becomes a disambiguation problem. Most current methods rely on scientific writing conventions to disambiguate the full form of a given acronym. Inexplicit global abbreviations appear typically in clinical narratives without their full form definition, so cannot rely on conventions. Recognition of global acronyms usually entails mapping to a synonymous entry in an external dictionary, this can be viewed as a word sense disambiguation problem. </p>
